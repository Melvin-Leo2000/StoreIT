## General Information

## About Us

Weâ€™re a group of NUS students who also lives on campus and faces the problem of bringing home lots of belongings and items every time the semester comes to an end. Realizing this pain point, we launched StoreIT in winter of 2022 under the NUS Entrepreneurship Society's "Start" programme in hopes to resolve storage problems faced by students by batching and reducing the cost + hassle of moving their items to and from school.

<br>
We have developed this web app as a platform for students to place their general information and details regarding the duration, cost and number of items they want to store over the holidays. The web app also provides general information about our business project, steps on placing an order, as well as contact functions for students to reach out should they have additional queries.

## User Stories

Many students, especially foreign students, feels that its a hassle to move tons of items back to their home country at the end of every semester just to move it back home. As such, StoreIT helps them to store their items in school at a fee, providing greater convenience and ease as they travel back home, returning their items on time.

## Key features

**Order page**

An official forms for students to record their details and information regarding their storage duration, number of items, collection and return time.

Simple forms that records additional queries regarding the business to reach out easily to us.


**Admin page**
